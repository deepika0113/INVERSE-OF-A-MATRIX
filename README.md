# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: Using the np.linalg.solve(), we can find the solutions.
### Step 3: Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()
### Step 4: End the program

## Program:
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: R.DEEPIKA
#RegisterNumber: 212224100009
```
import numpy as np
a = [[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]]
sol = np.linalg.inv(a)
print(sol)
```
## Output:
